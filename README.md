# Plasmonics Research

## Overview
This project is focused on simulating plasmons in a series of geometries in order to optimize/maximize field enahcement factors. 

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:
- Meep
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- h5py
- glob
- os

## Simulation Details


## Visualization
The electric field data is visualized using matplotlib's animation function. The actual geometry is overlaid on the simulation. The animation is saved as 'animation.mp4'.

## Future Work
The next steps in this research include implementing an adjoint optimization solver to optimize the geometry for specific applications.It would also be greatly helpful to find a way to conver the geometries that MEEP recongizes from Onshape or SOLIDWORKS files.
