Choose the wave optics modules instad, Frequency Domain: 

[1 700 THz]

Parameters:

wl: 500 nm 
p: 300 nm //periodic distnact

Make sure the height is longer than several wavelengths

Add PML 
100 nm is typically fine 
JOhnson and Christy typical Au 

Mesh size: 
If you want to add field enhancement, add Aluminum Oxide layer, or some thin dielectric layer

Si --> Somewhat lossy for visible spectra
Au Substrate preferred, try with, assumed no transmission because the substrate is thick enough!'

Stacking dielectrics, fractal geometries for high field enhancement

Experimental possibilities:
-Multiple electroplating
